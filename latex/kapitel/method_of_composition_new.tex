\section{Method of Composition - New}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Sample $\boldsymbol{\theta}^*_{(k)}$ from variational posterior of $\boldsymbol{\theta}_{(k)}$, $q(\boldsymbol{\theta}_{(k)} | \boldsymbol{X}, \boldsymbol{W})$.
\item Run regression model with response $\boldsymbol{\theta}^*_{(k)}$ and covariates $\boldsymbol{X}$ to obtain estimates of regression coefficients $\hat{\boldsymbol{\xi}}^*$ and covariance of $\hat{\boldsymbol{\xi}}^*$, $\hat{\boldsymbol{V}}^*_{\xi}$.
\item Sample $\tilde{\boldsymbol{\xi}}^*$ from $F(\hat{\boldsymbol{\xi}}^*, \hat{\boldsymbol{V}}^*_{\xi})$, where $F$ is asymptotic distribution of $\hat{\boldsymbol{\xi}}^*$.
\end{enumerate}

According to \cite{treier2008democracy} and the authors of the STM, $\tilde{\boldsymbol{\xi}}^*$ can be considered a sample from the posterior of $\boldsymbol{\xi}$, taking into account the uncertainty in $\boldsymbol{\theta}_{(k)}$. Given a new set of covariates values $X^*$, the function \textit{estimateEffect} (together with its \textit{plot} method) of the R package \textit{stm} predicts proportions for these covariate values using $\boldsymbol{X}^*\tilde{\boldsymbol{\xi}}^*$ as linear predictor. This approach is used to visualize relationships between covariates and proportions together with the uncertainty contained within. Specifically, $\boldsymbol{X}^*$ is a matrix, where each column apart from the respective variable of interest, corresponds to the median of the respective column of $\boldsymbol{X}$.

Problems
\begin{enumerate}
\item In STM, regression model employed in step 2 is OLS; however OLS is not appropriate to model proportions.
\item $\tilde{\boldsymbol{\xi}}^*$ can only be considered a sample from the posterior of $\boldsymbol{\xi}$ in certain bayesian regression models with questionable (uniform) prior assumptions.
\item Using $\boldsymbol{X}^*\tilde{\boldsymbol{\xi}}^*$ as linear predictor does \textit{not} yield a sample of the posterior predictive distribution; thus uncertainty estimate is not realistic
\item Separate modeling of topic proportions neglects dependence among variables.
\end{enumerate}
